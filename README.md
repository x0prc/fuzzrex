A CLI tool designed to identify vulnerabilities in RESTful APIs and their associated configuration files through intelligent fuzz testing.

# Core Features
1. **Dynamic API Fuzzing**:
    - Parse OpenAPI specifications.
    - Generate and send fuzzed requests to API endpoints.
    - Monitor responses for errors or unexpected behaviors.
2. **Configuration File Fuzz Testing**:
    - Support multiple configuration file formats (JSON, YAML, XML).
    - Generate malformed configurations and test application behavior.
    - Log issues and provide recommendations.
3. **Reporting**:
    - Generate comprehensive reports for both API fuzzing and configuration testing.
